            <p name="5c5f" id="5c5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Years back when i was just out of college and
              the fire of coding had just started, one of the first questions i was asked was, where do you see yourself
              in 3 years ?</p>
            <p name="8cd0" id="8cd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My enthusiasm in those early moments was very
              high, and my immediate response would be i want to be the best.</p>
            <p name="3ce1" id="3ce1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was certainly too over confident about my
              self, highly over estimated my skills and intellectual capacity and definitely did not realise the depth
              of my statement.</p>
            <p name="e976" id="e976" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today 3 years after writing code as my job and
              passion, i realize what it would require to be the best.</p>
            <p name="1ee3" id="1ee3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Let’s start with an example :</p>
            <p name="fc4d" id="fc4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somewhere around the late 1990s and in the early
              2000s, imagine yourself as a very successful developer playing a major role in writing a java j2me app or
              game ( the tiny little .jar apps you would download and install on the symbian and java phones )</p>
            <p name="594d" id="594d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You would be on top of the world, thinking that
              this is it, this happy little world of yours would last forever, but the thing about technology is that it
              keeps changing for the better and few years from then you have android, ios, blackberry and what not.</p>
            <p name="1586" id="1586" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few years back AngularJS came, a lot of web
              developers liked it, a lot of companies built their products on it, and a while back Google released a
              complete rewrite of it, All that time spent understanding a specific framework… boom… all gone…</p>
            <p name="1b50" id="1b50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what do we take from all this ?</p>
            <p name="0a54" id="0a54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best developer is a relative term bound to
              the time you live in…</p>
            <p name="c9ff" id="c9ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is no rest, the only way to be ahead is to
              keep learning new things, keep contributing, thats the only way…</p>
            <p name="10ae" id="10ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never forget your roots…</p>
            <p name="3cee" id="3cee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The basic rules are all the
              same and most important, the implementation changes with time,</p>
            <p name="5375" id="5375" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also listen to people who have more experience
              than you, they might have come from technologies which may seem ancient to you but they have lived through
              it, they see the bigger picture which the young blood flowing through your veins fails to visualize…</p>
            <p name="823d" id="823d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This applies to life too, never forget where you
              came from, and never make this your destination,</p>
            <p name="782a" id="782a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As for me, i now realize that im just a tiny ass
              spec in one hell of a dynamic ass universe,</p>
            <p name="21f8" id="21f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Being ahead in this technolgical rat race no
              longer amazes me, that being better than before makes much more sense than being the best,</p>
            <p name="1bf7" id="1bf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My passion hasn’t changed nor my thirst
              for knowledge, But i truly believe now that it is much more important to learn things the right way,</p>
            <p name="a5ba" id="a5ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That learning is a life long process, i can’t
              finish within a day or a year,</p>
            <p name="2810" id="2810" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That a software is just a partial representation
              of the real world,</p>
            <p name="9f58" id="9f58" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I dont want to be the best anymore…</p>
            <p name="8666" id="8666" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to learn Spanish,</p>
            <p name="ec7f" id="ec7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to trek in the rain forests</p>
            <p name="90ef" id="90ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to go on a road trip with the people that
              never change, unlike technology.</p>
            <p name="6144" id="6144" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to spend time with the people i should,
            </p>
            <p name="75fc" id="75fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want to see places, make new friends, realize
              my mistakes, forgive myself, forgive others, and finally live the life ive taken for granted since such a
              long time.</p>
            <p name="71a7" id="71a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I may have got distracted from a
              childish goal, but may have found my purpose along the way</p>
